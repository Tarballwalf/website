## Scripts for creating unlimited Team Drives

These websites allow you to get team drives/shared drives from different school domains

Due to the huge amount of abuse, Google has started adding restrictions on EDU domains. Schools and university with a free subscription will ONLY have 100TB of storage for all users IN TOTAL, the more students a university has, the less storage you will have (depending on each user's storage usage).

You can use non profit organizations shared drive (they are not limited yet) but don't abuse them or Google will put limits on non profit subscription too.

The following links are **no longer working** and are kept for archival proposes. 

* [Multiple schools](https://td.fastio.me/)
* [University of Sheffield](https://gdrive.zppcw.cn/)
* [Washington University](https://gdrive.oso.ac.cn/)
* [Taiwan Primary School](https://gd.404edu.workers.dev/)
* [SWCCD](https://teamdrive.xcpx.workers.dev/)
* [CCSF](https://teamdrive.mfoxx.workers.dev)

I suggest getting more then one team drive from different domains and keep backups.

If you're worried about the safety of the data in the dives, school admins won't take them down if you keep them private. More information about team drives [here](https://telegra.ph/A-complete-guide-of-shared-drive-Team-drive-01-23).
